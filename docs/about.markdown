Hey there! I am valhrafnaz (they/them), and I sometimes code or write papers! I am a philologist specialising in Old Norse literature and language by trade.
Currently, I am getting my rust skills up-to-date so I can start working on some little game ideas in Godot 4 + Rust via GDNative.

Repo for the first (as of yet empty) project: [A Cold, Dark and very Gentle Place]: https://github.com/Valhrafnaz/ACDGP

If I do some writing that does not involve my actual name, I'll be sure to post that here.

Anyways, y'all have a great day!
